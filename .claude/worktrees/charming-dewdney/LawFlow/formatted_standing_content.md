# STANDING - Article III Justiciability

## Overview
Standing is a constitutional requirement under Article III that determines whether a plaintiff has the right to bring a case before a federal court. It ensures that courts only hear actual "cases" or "controversies" rather than abstract disputes.

## Three Requirements

To establish standing, a plaintiff must satisfy **all three** of the following elements:

### 1. Injury-in-Fact
- **Definition**: A concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent injury
- The injury must be:
  - **Concrete**: Real and not abstract
  - **Particularized**: Affecting the plaintiff in a personal and individual way
  - **Actual or Imminent**: Either already occurred or will definitely occur

### 2. Causation
- **Definition**: The injury must be fairly traceable to the defendant's challenged conduct
- The plaintiff must show a causal connection between the defendant's actions and the harm suffered
- The connection cannot be too attenuated or speculative

### 3. Redressability
- **Definition**: A favorable court decision must be likely to remedy the injury
- The court must be able to provide relief that will actually address the harm
- If the court's decision cannot fix the problem, there is no standing

## Key Case
**Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife (1992)**: Established the modern three-part test for standing and emphasized that all three elements must be present.

## Exam Trap: Generalized Grievances
- **Generalized grievances** = **No standing**
- A plaintiff cannot bring a case based solely on a general interest shared by all citizens
- The injury must be specific to the plaintiff, not just a general complaint about government policy

## Mnemonic Device
**ICR** = **I**njury, **C**ausation, **R**eddressability: "**I Can't Reach**" the courthouse without all three.

## Additional Notes
- Standing is a threshold issue that must be satisfied before a court can hear the merits of a case
- Each element must be proven independently
- Failure to establish any one element results in dismissal for lack of standing
